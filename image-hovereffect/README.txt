A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at https://codepen.io/pie22/pen/MQZerb.

 *Updated to use Flexbox :)* Nice little effect on hover for a blog post, image, etc. Text preview is limited to 3 lines with a read more button. Date or Author stamp in the bottom right.

Includes: top, left, bottom, and right effects, diagonals from each corner.

Distant future: direction-aware hover, serves the right effect based on the mouse position when entering the target area.
